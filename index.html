    <h1>Happy Birthday, Nishat!</h1>
    <p>Hope it’s fine out there, and life isn’t too harsh on you, and things are going pretty well. Okay, I guess this phrasing sounds quite pessimistic. Now that it is your birthday, I should be in a more optimistic tone.</p>
    
    <p>So, yes, it’s another year to be on the shore of this... what should I say? Majestic world.</p>
    
    <p>Time just flies away. Sometimes, in some of my half-awake sleep, if I think of something, there will be this old, shattered place. They will be all sorts of bizarre and coming from my childhood. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose(এই শব্দবহুল অতিকথন হয়তো চলতেই থাকবে), so let me simply add that I remember you from that vivid time. (This part is a V for Vendetta reference; I guess you might not understand, but it’s fine anyway.)</p>

    <p>“Once Ernest Hemingway said, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.”</p>

    <p>Who said this? I can’t recall right now, but I believe it matches your aura. Hope you are making your little corner of the world worth living in.</p>

    <p>I don’t know whether a bizarre birthday note from me will brighten or darken your day, but that’s okay.</p>
